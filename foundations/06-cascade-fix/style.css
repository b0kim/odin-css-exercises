/* 
Solution 1: 
Move the below rule to after the .para rule

.small-para {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-weight: 800;
}

Why it works: Change the rule order (for two rules with equal specificity, the rule
that was declared last wins)

Solution 2: 
Change the .small-para rule declaration by chaining two selectors, as shown in the 
code above. 

Why it works: Having two class selectors results in higher specificity, so this modified 
rule now takes precedence.

} 

/* 
Solution 1:
Move the below rule to after the .button rule

.confirm {
  background: green;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
} 

Why it works: Utilize rule order such that the .confirm rule overwrites the 
background and text colors of the targeted button element 

Solution 2:
Change declaration to .button.confirm (chain two selectors as shown above)

Why it works: This rule now uses two selectors, so the specificity is higher

Solution 3:
Change declaration to #confirm-button

Why it works: ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors

/* 
Solution 1:
Change .child rule declaration to div.child and move it below the div.text rule

Why it works: The modified rule has equal specificity, and moving it below gives it 
precedence via rule order

Solution 2:
Change .child rule declaration to div.child.text (rule order doesn't matter)

Why it works: The modified rule now has higher specificity (2 class selectors vs 1 class
selector)

Solution 3:
Change div.text rule declaration to just .text and move it above .child rule

Why it works: The two rules now have equal specificity and precedence is decided by 
rule order

Solution 4:
Change .child rule declaration to .text .child (descendent combinator)

Why it works: This rule now has higher specificity (2 class selectors vs 1 class selector)

Solution 5:
Change .child rule to div .child and move it  below the div.text rule

Why it works: Rules now have same specificity (1 class + 1 type), so it must go to rule order

Solution 6:
Change .child to div div.child 

Why: Higher Specificity
